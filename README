VDFST-CFP (Variable Density Flow and Solute Transport - Conduit Flow Process)

This is the code/model to simuate density-dependent seawater intrusion/submarine groundwater discharge processes in a dual-permeability aquifer system (e.g, karst aquifer). 
Density-dependent groundwater flow and salt transport are coupled.
Non-laminar flow in the conduit and darcial flow in the porous medium are coupled.

If you would like to use/modify the code, please contact me first.
